# User Story: Implement Power of Two Function in mad calc

## Title

Implement the power of two function in the CLI calculator

## Status

Completed

## As a

Primary school student (ages 6-12)

## I want to

Calculate the power of two for a given number (e.g., 2^2, 3^2)

## So that

I can solve math problems that involve squaring numbers, just like in my schoolwork

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The calculator can correctly compute the square of any given number.
2.  Inputting "pow2 X" (where X is a number) returns X multiplied by itself.
3.  Inputting "pow2 0" returns 0.
4.  Inputting "pow2 1" returns 1.
5.  Inputting "pow2 -X" (where X is a positive number) correctly computes the square of the negative number.
6.  Inputting invalid non-numeric input for power of two returns a child-friendly error message.
7.  The result is displayed clearly to the user.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add a new command/keyword for power of two (e.g., "pow2") to the CLI parser. (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- [x] Implement the power of two calculation logic within the Calculation Engine. (AC: 1, 3, 4, 5)
- [x] Integrate the power of two logic with the CLI input/output handling. (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- [x] Add unit tests for the power of two function, covering: (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    - [x] Valid positive integer inputs.
    - [x] Valid positive decimal inputs.
    - [x] Input of zero.
    - [x] Input of one.
    - [x] Negative inputs.
    - [x] Non-numeric inputs.
- [x] Ensure child-friendly error messages for invalid power of two inputs. (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No specific insights from the previous stories directly impact the implementation of the power of two function, other than the general approach to integrating new operations into the existing calculator structure.

### Data Models

No specific data models are required for this story beyond standard numerical types.

### API Specifications

No API endpoints are involved; this is a CLI function.

### Component Specifications

The CLI Interface will need to recognize the "pow2" command. The Calculation Engine will house the core logic. Input/Output Handling will manage displaying results and error messages.

### File Locations

New methods/classes for the power of two function should be added within the `school.madcalc` package structure.

### Testing Requirements

Unit tests should be written using JUnit for all operations and input scenarios.
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#5-extensibility-&-testing]

### Technical Constraints

The implementation should adhere to the Java CLI application structure.
